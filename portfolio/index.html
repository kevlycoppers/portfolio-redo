          <h2>Job Experience</h2>
          <p>Only being 19 years old, I have not had the opportuinity to have many jobs undermy belt. However I make up for that with skills. I'm great at learning things quickly and have those skills stay with me for a long time. Even when faced with difficulties I like the challenge and push through. So far coding has been difficult, but the reward of seeing your long hour and hard work come to fruition is fantastic. I graduated from High school about 1 year ago and since then work a job as an indusrial janitor. There we cleaned newly built or refurnished office buildings so that the new tenants could move in. Before that I had worked a minimum wage job, while in school, at a auto parts shop. It taught me better people skills, which everyone could be better at. After graduating high school I needed to do something with my life, besides work a full time job that wasnt going anywhere. So after a friend told me about learning to code I took interest and signed up to Epicodus. </p>

          <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
          <p>My personal intersests range very wide, to many different catagories. I love to work with cars, which is a hard and very raw environment, but I also love to garden, more of a whole body experience for the senses. I love playing Video games and driving, where I'll sit for hours on end. On the other hand I love to play Tennis and garden, both of which are very active and, at times, very intense. These things have taught me a lot of patients. During my life I've become attracted to more expensive hobbies, on accident I swear. They just end up being expensive, it's not like I try to. Computer hardware, Fish keeping, Shoe collecting, and Cars are all very expensive things and growing up in a family without a lot of money meant that if I wanted something, then I had to work for it for myself. This tought me patients and dedication. And Anime and Manga are just fun to watch and read.  </p>
